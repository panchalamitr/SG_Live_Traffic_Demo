**Description**

1) Login Screen (Google, Facebook Login) 
I have done login operation in SocialLoginActivity 

2) NewsHeadLinesActivity
I have fetch data from the (The Guardian Open Platform) API and displayed those records. 
I have followed MVVM Architecture in this screen 
I have created NewsHeadLinesActivityas UI, NewsHeadLinesViewModel as ViewModel and NewsHeadLinesRepository as Repository

3) DetailNewsActivity
Here I just need to display 5 to 10 lines of detail description, but I could not found detail description so I have load that webpage using Webview.
