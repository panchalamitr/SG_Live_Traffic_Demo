**Description**

1) Map Screen
Fetch data from the https://data.gov.sg/ and shows camera location on Singapore Map. </br>
This api is being called every minute to get updated image. </br>
Instead of removing and adding marker every minute, I have just updated it's camera Uri (which is updating every minute)
